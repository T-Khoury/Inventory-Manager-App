[{"id":44,"name":"Bonfire Japanese Maple","description":"The Bonfire Japanese Maple (Acer palmatum 'Bonfire') is an amazing variety of maple that stands out for its stunning display of blazing scarlet new growth throughout the growing season. The lime green foliage that emerges in spring is a lovely contrast against the fiery foliage that comes later. This is one tree everyone will admire and appreciate. Not only is it gorgeous, it is easy to care for and compact, making it a garden favorite. It can also be grown in containers and provides much needed color and interest in autumn. All of these unique qualities make the Bonfire Japanese Maple a truly special addition to any garden.","category":"tree","images":{"license":451,"license_name":"CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","original_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/species_image/44_acer_palmatum_bonfire/og/sk3776-image-kwvuoab1.jpg","regular_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/species_image/44_acer_palmatum_bonfire/regular/sk3776-image-kwvuoab1.jpg","medium_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/species_image/44_acer_palmatum_bonfire/medium/sk3776-image-kwvuoab1.jpg","small_url":"https://perenual.com/storage/species_image/44_acer_palmatum_bonfire/small/sk3776-image-kwvuoab1.jpg","thumbnail":"https://perenual.com/storage/species_image/44_acer_palmatum_bonfire/thumbnail/sk3776-image-kwvuoab1.jpg"},"stock":41,"price":"$77.99"}]
